# The HTML5 Shiv Nuget Package

This is a fork of the original repo designed solely to be used to create an up-to-date NuGet package.  The package can be found by searching for **HTML5.HTML5Shiv**.

You can find more information on the HTML5 Shiv by visiting the [original repository](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv). 

## NuGet Package

A NuGet Package for use with Asp.Net.  This package includes both the html5shiv.js file and the html5shiv-printshiv.js files (and minified version of both files).  The package will install these files in your Scripts folder.

### HTML5 Shiv

The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.

### What do these files do?

#### `html5shiv.js`
*  This includes the basic `createElement()` shiv technique, along with monkeypatches for `document.createElement` and `document.createDocumentFragment` for IE6-8. It also applies [basic styling](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/blob/51da98dabd3c537891b7fe6114633fb10de52473/src/html5shiv.js#L216-220) for HTML5 elements for IE6-9, Safari 4.x and FF 3.x.

####`html5shiv-printshiv.js` 
*  This includes all of the above, as well as a mechanism allowing HTML5 elements to be styled and contain children while being printed in IE 6-8.

It is also distributed with [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), and the two google code projects, [html5shiv](https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) and [html5shim](https://code.google.com/p/html5shim/), maintained by [Remy Sharp](https://twitter.com/rem).

For more information, head to the original repository for the [HTML5Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv).

## Usage

Include the HTML5 shiv at the top of your `<head>` in a conditional comment after any stylesheets.

```html
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
	<script src="/Scripts/html5shiv.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

## HTML5 Shiv API

HTML5 Shiv works as a simple drop-in solution. In most cases there is no need to configure HTML5 Shiv or use methods provided by HTML5 Shiv.

### `html5.elements` option

The `elements` option is a space separated string or array, which describes the **full** list of the elements to shiv. 

**Configuring `elements` before `html5shiv.js` is included.**

```js
//create a global html5 options object
window.html5 = {
  'elements': 'mark section customelement' 
};
```
**Configuring `elements` after `html5shiv.js` is included.**

```js
//change the html5shiv options object 
window.html5.elements = 'mark section customelement';
//and re-invoke the `shivDocument` method
html5.shivDocument(document);
```

### `html5.shivCSS`

If `shivCSS` is set to `true` HTML5 Shiv will add basic styles (mostly display: block) to sectioning elements (like section, article). In most cases a webpage author should include those basic styles in his normal stylesheet to ensure older browser support (i.e. Firefox 3.6) without JavaScript.

The `shivCSS` is true by default and can be set false, only before html5shiv.js is included: 

```js
//create a global html5 options object
window.html5 = {
	'shivCSS': false
};
```

### `html5.shivMethods`

If the `shivMethods` option is set to `true` (by default) HTML5 Shiv will override `document.createElement`/`document.createDocumentFragment` in Internet Explorer 6-8 to allow dynamic DOM creation of HTML5 elements. 

Known issue: If an element is created using the overridden `createElement` method this element returns a document fragment as its `parentNode`, but should be normally `null`. If a script relays on this behavior, `shivMethods`should be set to `false`.
Note: jQuery 1.7+ has implemented his own HTML5 DOM creation fix for Internet Explorer 6-8. If all your scripts (including Third party scripts) are using jQuery's manipulation and DOM creation methods, you might want to set this option to `false`.

**Configuring `shivMethods` before `html5shiv.js` is included.**

```js
//create a global html5 options object
window.html5 = {
	'shivMethods': false
};
```
**Configuring `elements` after `html5shiv.js` is included.**

```js
//change the html5shiv options object 
window.html5.shivMethods = false;
```

### `html5.createElement( nodeName [, document] )`

The `html5.createElement` method creates a shived element, even if `shivMethods` is set to false.

```js
var container = html5.createElement('div');
//container is shived so we can add HTML5 elements using `innerHTML`
container.innerHTML = '<section>This is a section</section>';
```

### `html5.createDocumentFragment( [document] )`

The `html5.createDocumentFragment` method creates a shived document fragment, even if `shivMethods` is set to false.

```js
var fragment = html5.createDocumentFragment();
var container = document.createElement('div');
fragment.appendChild(container);
//fragment is shived so we can add HTML5 elements using `innerHTML`
container.innerHTML = '<section>This is a section</section>';
```
